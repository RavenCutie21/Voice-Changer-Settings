My settings for W-Okada's Realtime voice changer client.

This is not a one stop shop just my recommendations for what YOU the person reading this should use, depending on your hardware. But FIRST let's get some stuff out of the way

Before even starting find your start_http.bat file, right click it and create a shortcut, if you do not know how to create a shortcut, figure it out. Put that new shortcut on your desktop so you can easily access it, we will make a better version of this shortcut later that uses even less resources once everything is 100% working.

IF your GPU is not showing and you have an NVidia Graphics card make sure you have the NVIDIA Cuda Toolkit drivers installed, you can do a google search and find it.

If you are on AMD you should have the DirectML version of W-Okada's Realtime voice changer client installed. To tell the difference if you look at the GPU section, if theres a dropdown menu, thats the NVidia one, as of Version 11. If it says cpu, 0, 1, 2, 3, then you are on the correct AMD one. 

For AMD open your task manager (control+shift+escape) Press Performance, and you should see your GPU listed as GPU #, usually it will be 0, but sometimes it can be something else,

That number listed is what you would select inside of W-Okada's client to use your gpu.


I will embed the images later for now refer to the screenshots in the folders...
